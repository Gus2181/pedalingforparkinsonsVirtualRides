    Tacoma was originally inhabited by Native Americans, but became colonized by European settlers. Specifically to Tacoma, a Swedish man build a sawmill which was powered by
    water on a creek connected to present-day Tacoma, and a small settlement was built around it. This was however abandoned in the mid 1850's. Later, in 1864, John Carr decided
    to make this area the end of the Transcontinental Railroad, hoping to profit off of the selection, he would then sell most of his claim to a developer, who would name this project
    Tacoma City, after the indigenous name of the nearby Mount Rainier. Tacoma would later become a large town for smelting and industrial work, which would struggle during the Great
    Depression. Later, however, in the 1990's, efforts were underway to revitalize the city of Tacoma, including the creation of several museusms, and a light rail.
    <br /><br />
    In addition to that, Tacoma has several historic landmarks. These include Engine House No. 9, a fire house built in 1907 which now houses a pub and microbrewery, Stadium High School,
    which was used in the movie <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>, <i>Fireboat No. 1</i>, which was used for waterfront fire protection, water pollution control, and search and rescue missions.
    This boat is one of only five fireboats which is designated as a National Historic Landmark. Tacoma is also home to the William Ross Rust House, they Murray Morgan Bridge, National Realty
    Building, Tacoma Dome, as well as others (image courtesy of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mount_Rainier_overlooking_the_Port_of_Tacoma.jpg" title="via Wikimedia Commons">Broran28</a> / Public domain).</p></div>

    <div class = "infoL" style = "width: 45%; margin: 0px 10px 20px 0"><p>Tacoma also has some notable figures in pop culture. It has been the home of several professional sports players, being
    NBA point guard Isaiah Thomas, and NFL cornerback Desmond Trufant (information courtesy of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington">Wikipedia.com</a>).
    <br /><br />
    Outside of athletics, there have been several notable actors from Tacoma, including Cam Gigandet, Pamela Reed, and Blair Underwood (information courtesy of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington">Wikipedia.com</a>).
    However, in the world of acting, the most notable name to come out of Tacoma is Bing Crosby. Crosby had prolific careers in both acting and singing. In regards to his film career, Crosby was know for
    starring in seven <i>Rode To</i> musical comedies alongside Bob Hope. Although they were never an official duo, they starred together often and when performing solo, both would make fun of each other
    in a comedically insulting way. He additionally won an Academy Award for Best Actor for 1944's <i>Going My Way</i>, and received nominations for the sequel, 1945's <i>The Bells of St. Mary's</i>, and for his part as
    an alcoholic entertainer in <i>The Country Girl</i>. Regarding his career in music, Crosby is notable for songs such as "Out of Nowhere" and "At Your Command," and for influencing the likes of Frank Sinatra,
    Elvis Presley, and John Lennon (information courtesy of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby">Wikipedia.com</a>).
    <br /><br />
    On the topic of music, Tacoma is also the birthplace of Jerry Cantrell, who is most notable for being the guitar-player, co-singer, and songwriter for Alice in Chains. Throughout the bands career,
    Cantrell wrote some of the band's most popular songs, including "Rooster," which was a tribute to Cantrell's father, and the tribute to Andrew Wood, titled "Would?" (information courtesy of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Cantrell">Wikipedia.com</a>,
